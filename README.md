In this App one file is missing which I was not able to upload due to system issue. So for that I suggest You, to create a new Project by your own and Install all the dependencies mentioned in my package.json file and after than that copy the app folder and assets folder to get all the files which I've used to  create this App. and also look at once to my index.js file (root level) because in that file I have implemented the Redux Store Porviders.
